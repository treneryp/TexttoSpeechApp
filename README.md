# TexttoSpeechApp
 This is a rough version of a Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) Application for Android. It is currently very early and missing key functionality as well as prone to errors.

This project was Developed In Android Studios, and as such it contains a lot of pre-generated scripts for building the files and ect. 

The core of the code, is located at app/src/main/java/com/example/patrick/MainActivity.java
That is the crux of the program.
